# Book Store App - Backend

This is the backend repository for the Book Store App, a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The backend provides APIs to manage a collection of books, enabling users to perform CRUD operations. The frontend of the application can be found [here](https://book-store-app-frontend-amber.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books in the database.
- **Toggle View**: Supports both table and card views on the frontend.
- **Modal View**: Display book details in a small modal view.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API to manage book data.

## Live Demo

- **Frontend Live**: [https://book-store-app-frontend-amber.vercel.app/](https://book-store-app-frontend-amber.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (you can use MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based MongoDB)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayurk224/Book_Store_App-Backend.git
   cd Book_Store_App-Backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=5555
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   COLLECTION_NAME=your_collection_name
   ```

   - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.
   - Replace `your_collection_name` with the name of the collection (e.g., `books`).

4. **Start the Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:5555`.
